"""Python iterators and generators
Create a generator that generates the squares of numbers up to some number N.

Write a program using generator to print the even numbers between 0 and n in comma separated form where n is input from console.

Define a function with a generator which can iterate the numbers, which are divisible by 3 and 4, between a given range 0 and n.

Implement a generator called squares to yield the square of all numbers from (a) to (b). Test it with a "for" loop and print each of the yielded values.

Implement a generator that returns all numbers from (n) down to 0."""
